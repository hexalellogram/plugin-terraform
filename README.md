# plugin-terraform

A Terraform aliases plugin for Fisher. Uses the same aliases as the [oh-my-zsh Terraform plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/terraform/terraform.plugin.zsh).

Installation with Fisher:

```fish
fisher install hexalellogram/plugin-terraform
```

Structurally, the code for this plugin is heavily based off of the [Git plugin](https://github.com/jhillyerd/plugin-git).

The aliases that are set can be found in [this file](https://github.com/hexalellogram/plugin-terraform/blob/main/functions/__terraform.init.fish#L9).
