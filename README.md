# plugin-terraform

A Git aliases plugin for Fisher. Uses the same aliases as the [oh-my-zsh Terraform plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/terraform/terraform.plugin.zsh).

Installation with Fisher:

```fish
fisher install hexalellogram/plugin-terraform
```

Structurally, the code for this plugin is heavily based off of the [Git plugin](https://github.com/jhillyerd/plugin-git).
